an ode to nostalgia and growing up in the 90s - build your time capsule.

## About nostalgia
an ode to growing up in the 90s where:
- mtv trl was a thing
- waiting in line at fye to pick up your fav emo band's new cd to drop
- saving up your allowance and having your mom drive you to pick up a new video game
- where you spent time curating your aol / xanga / myspace profiles because it represented your identity

nowadays, moments are fleeting and you're just a split second in someone's social media feed. with nostalgia, you can curate a collection of what matters to you and record memories to look back on... or even to perhaps share in your dating profile to show more of your genuine self hiding behind that witty quote or photoshopped photo. ;)
